### I'm Matt Ramos, a Senior Software Engineer passionate about Distributed Systems, Go, Rust, and Swift.

I’ve been passionate about solving problems through technology since I started coding in 2014. Starting with C and C++ for IoT solutions, I’ve transitioned to building robust systems using Go, Rust, and Swift. Throughout my journey, I’ve designed resilient architectures that power scalable, high-performance solutions across backend, mobile, and distributed systems.

Always driven by innovation and a passion for problem-solving, I’m committed to delivering top-notch solutions that boost business outcomes and elevate user experiences. I wake up every day not just to make a living, but to make a difference, crafting solutions that leave a lasting impact through technology.
