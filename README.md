### I'm Matt Ramos, a Staff Software Engineer expert in Distributed Systems, AI, Rust, Flutter, Python and Go.

I’ve been passionate about solving problems through technology since I started my career in 2014, initially working with C and C++ for IoT solutions. Since then, I’ve transitioned to building robust distributed systems, throughout my journey, I’ve designed resilient architectures that power scalable, high-performance solutions across backend, mobile, and distributed systems. Today I focus on integrating cutting-edge AI/ML workflows, architecting reliable distributed systems, delivering beautiful cross-platform experiences with Flutter, and crafting performant backends in Rust, while leveraging Go and Python for supporting tools and automation.

Always driven by innovation and a passion for problem-solving, I’m committed to delivering top-notch solutions that boost business outcomes and elevate user experiences. I wake up every day not just to make a living, but to make a difference, crafting solutions that leave a lasting impact through technology.
